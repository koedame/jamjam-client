# Commit Message Generator

## Instructions

1. Run `git status` to check for all changes (staged, unstaged, untracked)
2. If there are unstaged or untracked files, run `git add -A` to stage all changes
3. Run `git diff --staged` to see what will be committed
4. If no changes to commit, inform the user and stop

### Pre-commit Checks

5. Run lint and test checks before committing:
   - Run `cargo fmt --check` to check formatting
   - Run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` to check for lint errors
   - Run `cargo test` to run tests

6. If any checks fail:
   - For formatting issues: Run `cargo fmt` to auto-fix
   - For clippy warnings: Read the affected files and fix the issues
   - For test failures: Investigate and fix the failing tests
   - After fixes, run `git add -A` to stage the fixes
   - Re-run the failed checks to verify fixes

7. Once all checks pass, generate a commit message following
   `.claude/rules/git-workflow.md` — the single source of truth for
   message format, style rules, and examples (always loaded; read the
   file if it is not in context)
8. Run `git commit -m "message"` immediately (no confirmation needed)
