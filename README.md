## Development

See the [documentation site](https://koedame.github.io/jamjam-client/) for detailed development guides.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/koedame/jamjam-client.git
cd jamjam-client

# Build core library
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Running the Desktop App (Tauri)

```bash
# Run from project root (not src-tauri directory)

# Development mode (frontend server starts automatically)
cargo tauri dev

# Production build (pass the server the app asks for its signaling server)
JAMJAM_SERVER_URL=https://<jamjam server> cargo tauri build
```

The built application will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

#### App identifier change (`com.jamjam.app` → `me.koeda.jamjam`)

If you ran the app before the identifier changed, the UI language choice and
recently used emojis reset once: the webview keeps them per identifier.
`config.toml` and the device identity are unaffected, as their location
comes from the app name `jamjam`. No migration is needed; pick the language
again in the app. The old webview data can be deleted:

| Platform | Old webview data |
|----------|------------------|
| macOS | `~/Library/WebKit/com.jamjam.app` (WKWebView's default store) |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/com.jamjam.app` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.jamjam.app` |
