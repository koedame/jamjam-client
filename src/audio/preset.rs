//! Audio presets and their application-induced latency budgets
//!
//! This module is the single source of truth for preset parameters and for the
//! one-way, application-induced latency each preset is allowed to cost.
//!
//! Before this module existed the same numbers lived in three places (ADR-008's
//! summary table, the Tauri config layer, and the E2E quality thresholds) and had
//! drifted apart. `src-tauri` now re-exports [`AudioPreset`] from here and the
//! latency tests derive their expectations from the same constants, so the GUI,
//! the audio path and the tests cannot disagree.
//!
//! ## Latency model
//!
//! One-way application-induced latency is the sum of three buffering stages
//! (ADR-008). Encode/decode is 0 ms because the default codec is uncompressed
//! PCM f32 (ADR-003):
//!
//! ```text
//! app_latency = capture_buffer + jitter_buffer + playback_buffer
//!             = frame_duration * (1 + jitter_buffer_frames + 1)
//! ```
//!
//! Network RTT is deliberately excluded: it is not attributable to the
//! application, and the top-priority requirement is that total latency
//! approaches "network RTT only".
//!
//! Budgets are defined in [`AudioPreset::max_app_latency_ms`] and justified in
//! ADR-019.
