//! Software audio pipeline
//!
//! Runs audio through the real jamjam send and receive path - codec, packet
//! serialisation and the play-out buffer with its PLC - without a network
//! socket or an audio device. This is what the loopback layer measures.
//!
//! What it does and does not cover:
//!
//! | Stage | Covered |
//! |-------|---------|
//! | Codec encode/decode | yes, the real `PcmCodec` |
//! | Packet serialisation | yes, the real `Packet::to_bytes` / `from_bytes` |
//! | Jitter buffer delay and reordering | yes, the real `PlayoutBuffer`, configured as the receive path configures it |
//! | Packet loss concealment | yes, the `PcmPlc` inside `PlayoutBuffer` |
//! | Capture and playback device buffers | no - see [`SoftwarePipeline::device_buffer_latency_ms`] |
//! | UDP transport, NAT traversal, encryption | no - covered by the network layers |
//!
//! Because the device buffers cannot exist without hardware, the pipeline
//! reports the delay it actually introduces, and callers add the two device
//! frame stages analytically to get the full application latency (ADR-019).
