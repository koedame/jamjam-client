//! Metric liveness checks
//!
//! The traceability checks (ADR-018) catch a *test* that asserts nothing. They
//! cannot catch a *product* value that looks measured but is a constant, and two
//! of those shipped:
//!
//! | Field | Was | Effect |
//! |-------|-----|--------|
//! | `ConnectionStats::packet_loss_rate` | `0.0` behind a TODO | the quality classification built on it could never report loss |
//! | `LocalLatencyInfo::jitter_buffer_ms` | `0.0`, setter never called | the latency breakdown omitted up to 42.67ms of buffering |
//!
//! Both were invisible to a grep and to every existing test, because a constant
//! is a perfectly valid value. What distinguishes a measurement from a constant
//! is that it *moves* when the thing it measures changes.
//!
//! Each test below applies a stimulus and asserts the metric responds. Adding a
//! field to one of these structs without adding it here leaves the same hole
//! open, so `.claude/rules/traceability.md` requires it.
